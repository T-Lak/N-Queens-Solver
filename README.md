## Overview
This project implements a hybrid approach combining a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Min-Conflicts heuristic to solve the [**N-Queens Problem**](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/queens) efficiently. 
The implementation is designed for performance optimization, using [bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards)
instead of arrays for representing chessboards, enabling efficient computations via bitwise operations.

## Features
- **üß¨ Chromosome Representation:** Bitboards representing queens' positions.
- **üéØ Selection Methods:** Tournament Selection (TM) & Roulette-Wheel Selection (RW).
- **üîÄ Crossover:** One-Point (OP) & Two-Point (TP) crossover.
- **üîÑ Mutation:** Swap Random (SR) & Swap Neighbor (SN) mutations.
- **üìä Fitness Function:** Based on the number of conflicts between queens.
- **üß© Min-Conflicts:** To guide solutions towards feasibility.

## Algorithm Workflow
The hybrid approach combines a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** with the **Min-Conflicts heuristic** to iteratively refine solutions for the N-Queens problem. The process consists of the following steps:

- **Initialization:**  
Generate an initial population of random board configurations. Each board is represented as a bitboard, enabling fast state manipulation.  

- **Selection:**  
Choose parents for the next generation using **`Tournament Selection (10% pool)`** or **`Roulette-Wheel Selection (20% rate)`**.  

- **Crossover:**  
Apply **`One-Point (90% probability)`** or **`Two-Point crossover`**, exchanging partial board states between parents.  

- **Mutation:**  
Introduce diversity using **`Swap Random (SR)`** or **`Swap Neighbor (SN)`** mutations, occurring with a **`3% probability`**.  

- **Conflict Reduction (Min-Conflicts Heuristic):**  
With a **`10% probability`**, the algorithm applies **`Min-Conflicts`** to adjust queen positions toward a conflict-free solution.  

- **Termination:**  
**`All valid solutions`** (conflict-free board) were found or the maximum limit of **`250 generations`** is reached.

## Experimental Results

Three experimental phases were conducted:

- **Phase 1 - Evaluation of different GA configurations on n=8:**  
Results showed that Tournament Selection and Two-Point Crossover yielded the best performance. Min-Conflicts significantly improved success rates, achieving up to 100% success rate in some configurations.
  
- **Phase 2 - Testing the hybrid approach on larger board sizes (n=10, 20, 30, 40, 50):**  
The bitboard-based representation allowed the algorithm to scale efficiently, consistently finding solutions in fewer than 5 generations for all tested board sizes.
  
- **Phase 3 - Assessing the ability to find all possible solutions for n=8‚Äì11:**  
Results indicated that Roulette-Wheel Selection consistently found 100% of all possible solutions, while Tournament Selection was slightly less consistent for larger n.
