## Overview
This project implements a hybrid approach combining a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Min-Conflicts heuristic to solve the N-Queens problem efficiently. 
The implementation is designed for performance optimization, using [bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards)
instead of arrays for representing chessboards, enabling efficient computations via bitwise operations.

## Features
- **üß¨ Chromosome Representation:** Bitboards representing queens' positions.
- **üéØ Selection Methods:** Tournament Selection (TM) & Roulette-Wheel Selection (RW).
- **üîÄ Crossover:** One-Point (OP) & Two-Point (TP) crossover.
- **üîÑ Mutation:** Swap Random (SR) & Swap Neighbor (SN) mutations.
- **üìä Fitness Function:** Based on the number of conflicts between queens.
- **üß© Min-Conflicts:** To guide solutions towards feasibility.

## Algorithm Workflow
The hybrid approach combines a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** with the **Min-Conflicts heuristic** to iteratively refine solutions for the N-Queens problem. The process consists of the following steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Generate an initial population of random board configurations.
   - Each board is represented as a bitboard, enabling fast state manipulation.
3. **Selection:**
    - Choose parents for the next generation using **Tournament Selection (10% pool) or Roulette-Wheel Selection (20% rate)**.
4. **Crossover:**
   - Apply **One-Point (90% probability)** or **Two-Point crossover**, exchanging partial board states between parents.
5. **Mutation:**
   - Introduce diversity using **Swap Random (SR)** or **Swap Neighbor (SN)** mutations, occurring with a **3% probability**.
6. **Conflict Reduction (Min-Conflicts Heuristic):**
    - With a **10% probability**, the algorithm applies **Min-Conflicts** to adjust queen positions toward a conflict-free solution.
7. **Termination:**
    - A valid solution (conflict-free board) is found.
    - The maximum limit of **250 generations** is reached.

## Experimental Results

Three experimental phases were conducted:

- **Phase 1 - Evaluation of different GA configurations on n=8:**  
Results showed that Tournament Selection and Two-Point Crossover yielded the best performance. Min-Conflicts significantly improved success rates, achieving up to 100% success rate in some configurations.
- **Phase 2 - Testing the hybrid approach on larger board sizes (n=10, 20, 30, 40, 50):**  
The bitboard-based representation allowed the algorithm to scale efficiently, consistently finding solutions in fewer than 5 generations for all tested board sizes.
- **Phase 3 - Assessing the ability to find all possible solutions for n=8‚Äì11:**  
Results indicated that Roulette-Wheel Selection consistently found 100% of all possible solutions, while Tournament Selection was slightly less consistent for larger n.
